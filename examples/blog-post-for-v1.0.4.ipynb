    "# Introducing WBGAPI: a new python package for accessing World Bank Data #\n",

    "Version 1.0.4 of the [wbgapi python package][pypi] is now available. This package has been in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) for almost a year, and the latest version adds several new features to make exploring and searching databases easier and more interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages for World Bank data have been around for a while, but WBGAPI is relatively new. I wrote this package to take advantage of some improvements in the API that have also been around for a while, but were difficult to understand or use, and not well supported in other packages. I also wanted to include better [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) support and in general make it easier to retrieve data without a lot of extra code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [README file][pypi] provides an overview and the package itself provides extensive documentation through python's help function. But just to get you started, here is a quick overview of 5 features that make WBGAPI unique.\n",

    "````\n",

    "Actually, the API consists of over 63 databases for a **total** (as of this writing) of 17,517 indicators. If you request an indicator such as population (SP.POP.TOTL) that is part of the World Development Indicators (WDI), the API returns the data from the WDI. But if you request one of the natural capital indicators (say NW.NCA.FORE.TO for forests) that is **not** in the WDI, the indicator comes from another database such as Wealth Accounts. And if you request a bunch of different indicators, it's possible they will come from different databases unless you explicitly specify which database you want for each indicator. To make it even more complicated, different databases often contain different countries and time periods, and are updated on different schedules. All of these details are available in the API, if you know how to find them.\n",
    "\n",
    "WBGAPI has a different implementation that provides greater clarity and consistency about which database your data is coming from and what that database includes. By default, data requests are made against the WDI; it's not possible to inadvertently get data from an unspecified dataset.\n",

WBGAPI includes a beta version of a country name lookup utility that can usually guess the correct code for names of countries in the UN system as well as those used by other international organizations and donors. The output is optimized for human readability, but is based on a python dictionary so it can be used programmatically as well."
